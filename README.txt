HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

A scientific expedition to a remote, unrealistic solar system has gone horribly wrong:
The system is passing through a dense asteroid field, endangering all of the research bases.
You, as the commander of the last functional ship, must go to each planet in the system and evacuate
the scientific crew on the orbiting research station.
You have limited fuel, asteroids are everywhere and time's running out!
